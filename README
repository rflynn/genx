 o=O   
0===0  genx searches for functions via a genetic algorithm, creating them
0===0  randomly from x86 machine language. The "fittest" ones are retained
 O=o   and mutated. Over time, better and better functions evolve.
  O    
 o=O   Why is this interesting?
0===0  
0===0  o Discover Unknown/Unexpected Relationships
 O=o     Given existing raw input and output data, genx can search for the
  O      simplest relationship between them.
 o=O   
0===0  o Automated Optimization
0===0    Given input and an existing function, genx can try to find simpler,
 O=o     more efficient equivalences.
  O    
 o=O   o It's Fast
0===0    Because the functions are expressed in native x86 they can be
0===0    executed by the CPU directly, allowing even my modest old laptop to
 O=o     process millions of candidates per minute.
