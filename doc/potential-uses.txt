Finding relationships between disparate data

  This is the coolest application I can think of: feeding in tables
  of input and output data and trying to boil down the relationship
  to the simplest mapping.

  -> Need support for multiple input parameters

Integer functions:
  generic hash functions
    -> Need ability to operate on strings
  minimal perfect hashing for specified datasets

Optimizing best-known implementations
  

Finding branchless implementations of existing functions
