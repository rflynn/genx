Finding relationships between disparate data

  This is the coolest application I can think of: feeding in tables
  of input and output data and trying to boil down the relationship
  to the simplest mapping.

  -> Need support for multiple input parameters

Integer functions:
  generic hash functions
    -> Need ability to operate on strings
  minimal perfect hashing for specified datasets

Finding non-obvious optimizations of known functions:

  Incorporate problems from the Bit-Twiddling Hacks site:
    Int.Bit.PopCnt.8
    Int.Bit.PopCnt.32
    Int.Bit.Reverse.8
    Int.Bit.Pow2Up.U32
    Int.Bit.HasZeroByte.32
    Int.Bit.Sign.S32
