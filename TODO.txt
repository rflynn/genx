TODO:

 * add support for the saving/retrieval of jobs, which will allow tasks to be
   resumed if the program crashes, and would even allow the transfer of jobs
   between machines.

 * define a proper interface so we can lib-ize the evolution/x86 part and can
   separate the "problem" we are trying to solve into a separate program.

 * add support for multiple input parameters

 * add support for some sort of cool visualization output, even if it's silly
   people are much more likely to be interested if we can at least show them
   that something is happening

   this would probably be a component separate from the actual crunching

 * implement some basic guidance for the function generation:

    * create an enumeration of all possible data storage destinations

    * for each instruction in X86 record which place is read and written

    * while calculating a single function, maintain a running tally of which
      places have been written to, and only choose from the pool of possible
      functions which reads operates from one of those places.

    this will increase the cost of generating a single function, but i believe
    it will produce output of higher quality, and thus reduce the overall time
    wasted on functions which are complete garbage.

 * implement a "simplify" function. this would identify effectless or redundant
   operations, such as performing some operations more than once in a row, and
   reduce them to canonical, equivalent operations
   
     hmm not so sure about this anymore, the overhead for doing it in every
     function would be far too great; but perhaps we could still apply it to
     our results
